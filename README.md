# LSTM for persian poetry

This work is based on script by *Hannah Vivian Shaw* cloned from <a href="https://github.com/vivshaw/shakespeare-LSTM">this repository</a>. The original work is done by  <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
">Andrej Karpathy blog</a>.

Besides some minor modification to the main code for trasition from English to Farsi. My main contribution is to provide a few utility function desgined to scrape the <a href="https://rira.ir/?page=view&mod=public&obj=module&id=classicpoems">rira website</a>. This is an excellent digital library that contains many books of classical Persian poetry of various poets.

Note:

I first worked on this in January of 2019, after finishing few course on deep learning in Coursera. Towards the end of this work and before moving toward write a blog about this work, I noticed that Afshin Kashefi a senior manager at Amazon has done exactly the same work and has published his results on LinkedIn. Therefore, at the time, I decided to move on from posting this work, and focus on other projects. 

Here is an example of poem generated by this model:



در ترا و هر که را یامد شدند

در عدو اندار من بعذور بند

چون ندارد شیر را آن زهر دید

از کل و اطبعت اگر چاری کشید

زانک دین را هست واناسد پدید

او نه دیدش گفت این را کار کرد

دو گمان برده که او خابر شدند

بر مر دل کشهای خود را و قدر

بند کاشت کی حمد آن بر سرست

اختلاف ما و هم شادی نهان
