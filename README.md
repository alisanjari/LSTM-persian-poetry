# LSTM for persian poetry

This work is based on script by *Hannah Vivian Shaw* cloned from <a href="https://github.com/vivshaw/shakespeare-LSTM">this repository</a>. The original work is done by  <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
">Andrej Karpathy blog</a>.

Besides some minor modification to the main code for trasition from English to Farsi. My main contribution is to provide a few utility function desgined to scrape the <a href="https://rira.ir/?page=view&mod=public&obj=module&id=classicpoems">rira website</a>. This is an excellent digital library that contains many books of classical Persian poetry of various poets.

I first worked on this project in January of 2019, right after finishing few courses on deep learning on Coursera. Towards the end of the work and before moving to write a blog about it, I found out that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khashei/
">Afshin Khashei</a> has already worked on this topic has wrote this nice <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trying-rnn-based-character-models-persian-poetry-afshin-khashei/">blog</a> about it. Therefore, at the time, I decided to move on and posting this work. However, I recently been asked to show case my skills, and therefore have decided to put up some of my projects on github.

Here is an example of a rumi style poem generated by this model:



در ترا و هر که را یامد شدند

در عدو اندار من بعذور بند

چون ندارد شیر را آن زهر دید

از کل و اطبعت اگر چاری کشید

زانک دین را هست واناسد پدید

او نه دیدش گفت این را کار کرد

دو گمان برده که او خابر شدند

بر مر دل کشهای خود را و قدر

بند کاشت کی حمد آن بر سرست

اختلاف ما و هم شادی نهان
